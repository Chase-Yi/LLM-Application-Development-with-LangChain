# Print Function Tutorial

```python
print("Dad!")
print("Mom!!")
```

### Explanation of Each Line

#### Line 1:
```python
print("Dad!")
```
- The `print` function is used to output text to the console.
- The text inside the parentheses, enclosed in double quotes (`" "`), is called a **string**.
- In this case, the string is `"Dad!"`, so the console will display:
  ```
  Dad!
  ```

#### Line 2:
```python
print("Mom!!")
```
- The `print` function is again used to output text.
- The string `"Mom!!"` is passed as an argument to `print`.
- This will output:
  ```
  Mom!!
  ```

### Understanding the `print` Function
- `print()` is a built-in Python function that outputs text to the console.
- It takes one or more arguments, typically strings, and displays them as output.
- Strings can be enclosed in either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).
- The `print` function automatically adds a newline (`\n`) at the end, meaning each `print` statement starts on a new line in the output.

### Expected Output:
```
Dad!
Mom!!
```
